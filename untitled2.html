Last week, SHP officials held a meeting that was also attended by police personnel from Pune, Raigad and Navi Mumbai, officials from the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation and IRB Infrastructure. The meeting was attended by office-bearers of SaveLIFE Foundation, which is working towards reducing fatalities on the Expressway, as well as independent researcher Tanmay Pendse.</p>

	Pendse lost his brother, Marathi actor Akshay Pendse, and nephew Pratyush, in an Expressway accident in December 2012. Since then, he has been doing extensive work to enhance the safety of the highway.

Amol Tambe, superintendent of police with SHP’s Pune division, said, “In the meeting, all the stakeholders discussed four key issues leading to accidental deaths. Lack of seat-belt usage, zig-zag driving and lane cutting, speeding beyond limits and illegal parking and sudden halting of vehicles.
