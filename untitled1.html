	<p style="color: white;font-size: 30px">In his purported Facebook profile, Anil Kumar Sharma, who allegedly assaulted Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal Tuesday, identifies himself as a “BJP worker”. His timeline is also replete with posts praising the Congress, though of late, he has been critical of the party. In several posts this month, Sharma has also used abusive words against Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia. On Wednesday, the comments section of his last post on November 18 sported abusive comments against him for assaulting Kejriwal.

Addressing the media on Wednesday, Sisodia referred to a few posts written by Sharma and claimed that it establishes his links with the BJP.</p>

	However, a quick scroll down Sharma’s timeline shows his shifting allegiances. In a post in June, he wrote: “Only Congress can be stand of every Indian citizen. BJP is bad and stupid party in our country (sic).” He also put up a picture featuring late PM Indira Gandhi last year, with the caption stating that he will serve the Congress all his life.

In May, Sharma posted that PM Narendra Modi has failed the country in the last four years. But his posts start being critical of the Gandhi family after June.

In recent posts, he has abused the Delhi CM. “I will spit at your (Kejriwal’s) nameplate,” one read.
