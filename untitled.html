Speaking to reporters in Haryana, Kejriwal said it was not a small matter that there have been four attacks on him in the last two years. While he did not name anyone, in Delhi, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia alleged the BJP was conspiring to kill the AAP chief.

“I do not think any CM has been attacked four times in two years, in India’s history… They can’t stand our growth… They have been rattled by the developmental work in Delhi,” Kejriwal said.

“People are asking them, if AAP could do it in two years, why could you not do that in the last 70 years? They feel people will now start questioning them more. Together, they want me to get killed. It’s their conspiracy. My entire being is dedicated to this nation and when I die, no matter how short my life is, every drop of my blood will be for this country,” he added.</p>

	Kejriwal was in Sonipat to hand over compensation of Rs 1 crore from the Delhi government fund to the kin of slain Haryana BSF jawan Narender Singh.

Sisodia alleged that the accused, Anil Kumar Sharma (41), was a BJP member: “Police conspired on the BJP’s directions. They want him (Kejriwal) to be killed. Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh spoke to the CM over phone. He wants the CM to lodge a complaint. What do we complain about when the entire incident took place in front of police? The BJP top leadership planned the attack… Even the home minister must have been aware. The BJP is conspiring to kill the CM.”
Dismissing the allegations, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said, “This method of getting sympathy is very old… whenever Lok Sabha or Assembly polls are to be held, such incidents take place… The CM has stage-managed this fabricated attack to divert attention from a fatal attack on me by (AAP MLA) Amanatullah Khan and the use of objectionable words by MLA Somnath Bharti against a woman journalist.”

Police said they are collecting evidence against the accused and probing if others were involved in the incident.
